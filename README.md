# ICECRAM-SHOP

Project Overview

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

Project Requirements
Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:


Create a class hierarchy – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.



Declare instance variables – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.



Write constructors – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.



Implement accessor and mutator methods – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.



Implement a toString() method – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.


Project Rubric:
See the 7 criteria you must demostrate attached to this assignment. Each criteria lists out a mastery level.

Pushing Project To GitHub:
You must push your project to your GitHub account that you shared earlier in the semester. This should be the last thing you do after you finish your project on Code.org's JavaLab. There are 3 videos in the project folder that will help you do this

Criteria	Grading Scale
Criteria	Grading Scale
Object Oriented Programming
4
Develops a superclass that represents a product or service the business offers.

AND

Develops more than one subclass that extends the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.

AND

Many examples of the superclass and subclasses are used in the Tester Class to print out the state of the instantiated objects.

3
Develops a superclass that represents a product or service the business offers.

AND

Develops one subclass that extends the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.

AND

Some examples of the superclass and subclasses are used in the Tester Class to print out the state of the instantiated objects.

2
Develops more than one class that represents a product or service the business offers but does not use inheritance to create subclasses from a superclass.

OR

No examples of the superclass and/or subclasses are used in the Tester Class to print out the state of the instantiated objects.

1
Develops a class that represents a product or service the business offers.

Instance Variables
4
Declares at least 3 relevant private instance variables with appropriate data types and names in the superclass that are shared with subclasses with no syntax errors.

AND

Declares at least 1 relevant private instance variable with appropriate data types and names in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass with no syntax errors.

3
Declares at least 2 relevant private instance variables with appropriate data types in the superclass that are shared with the subclass with no syntax errors.

AND

Declares at least 1 relevant private instance variable with appropriate data types in the subclass that are not shared with the superclass, but not all instance variables are relevant to the program with no syntax errors.

2
Declares relevant instance variables in each class with no syntax errors.

OR

Declares relevant instance variables in the superclass and subclasses, but the instance variables have public access or are not appropriate data types.

1
Does not declare relevant instance variables in any classes.

OR

Too many syntax errors to run the project.

Constructors
4
Writes a no-argument and more than one parameterized constructor in the superclass with no syntax errors.

AND

Writes a no-argument and more than one parameterized constructor in the subclasses that call the superclass constructor as appropriate using the super keyword with no syntax errors.

3
Writes a no-argument and a parameterized constructor in the superclass with no syntax errors.

AND

Writes a no-argument and a parameterized constructor in the subclass that calls the superclass constructor as appropriate using the super keyword with no syntax errors.

2
Writes a no-argument or parameterized constructor in a class with no syntax errors.

1
Does not write a constructor in any classes. 

OR

Too many syntax errors to run the project.

Accessor and Mutator Methods
4
Writes accessor methods for all instance variables in each class with no syntax errors.

AND

Writes mutator methods for all instance variables in each class with no syntax errors.

3
Writes accessor methods for most instance variables in each class with no syntax errors.

AND

Writes mutator methods for most instance variables in each class with no syntax errors.

2
Writes accessor and mutator methods for instance variables in a class with no syntax errors.

OR

Writes accessor or mutator methods for instance variables in the superclass but not the subclasses with no syntax errors.

1
Does not write accessor or mutator methods in any classes.

OR

Too many syntax errors to run the project.

toString() Method
4
Writes a toString() method in the superclass.

AND

Writes a toString() method in the subclasses that include the superclass toString() method.

3
Writes a toString() method in the superclass.

AND

Writes a toString() method in the subclass but does not include the superclass toString() method.

2
Writes a toString() method in a class.

1
Does not write a toString() method in any classes.

Documentation
4
Uses multi-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of all methods in the superclass and subclasses.

3
Uses multi-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of most methods in the superclass and subclasses.

OR

Uses single-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of methods in the super and subclasses.

2
Uses single-line or multi-line comments to explain the functionality and purpose of methods in only one class.

1
Does not use comments to document the functionality and purpose of methods or code segments in the program

GitHub
4
A GitHub repository is initialized with a README.md file, and all .java files for the project are added to the repository. The README template is used, UML Diagrams for classes are included, and for the “Description” section uses many vocab terms from class correctly.

3
A GitHub repository is initialized with a README.md file, and all .java files for the project are added to the repository. The README template is used, UML Diagrams for classes are included, and for the “Description” section uses some vocab terms from class correctly.

2
A GitHub repository is initialized with .java files for the project are added to the repository. No README file is added or no UML Diagram for classes are added and little vocab terms from class used correctly.

1
There is no GitHub repository on the personal account for this project or no README and .java files are added to repo.
